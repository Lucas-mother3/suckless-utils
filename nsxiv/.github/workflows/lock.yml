            Hi, thanks for the Pull-Request.
            However this repository is a read-only mirror, main development of nsxiv happens over at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nsxiv/nsxiv).
            Please open your Pull-Request over on the Codeberg Repo.
            Otherwise you may also e-mail the patch (obtained via `git format-patch`) to any of the [active maintainers](https://nsxiv.codeberg.page/man/#CURRENT%20MAINTAINERS) instead.
