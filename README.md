# Suckless Utilities 
## About 
These are my builds of suckless software such as dwm and st.
It's simple to compile these things. 

1. Install necessary tools and libraries 
2. Clone this repository 
3. Change directory to what suckless software do you want to use
4. Copy `make clean install` and paste it on your terminal
5. Insert dwm, slstatus or st inside your `.xinitrc` using your favorite text editor (usually located in `/home/<username>/.xinitrc`)
6. Start it and done!
