README file for SLiM

Rob Pearce <slim@flitspace.org.uk>

INTRODUCTION
    SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a graphical login manager for X11.
    It aims to be simple, fast and independent from the various
    desktop environments.
    SLiM was originally based on the last stable release of Login.app 
    by Per Lid√©n.

    Features:
    - External themes and configuration
    - PNG support with alpha transparency for panel
    - PNG / JPEG support for backgrounds
    - XFT / freetype support
    - Double or single (GDM-style) inputbox support
    - PAM support for authentication
    - Compatible with ConsoleKit or logind, OpenRC or systemd, etc.
    - CMake build procedure

INSTALLATION
    see the INSTALL file
    
USAGE
    SLiM is intended to be run automatically as part of the system 
    startup. Get your SysVInint, OpenRC or systemd to run the slim 
    executable, with the -d option if you want it to run as a daemon
    in the background (recommended for OpenRC, systemd may work 
    better without)

    As you would expect of a login manager, you enter your username 
    and password to login. By default, the ~/.xinitrc file is run, 
    so be sure to have a working .xinitrc file in your home. This 
    behaviour is configurable, and may be set up differently by the
    distro package.
    
    Special usernames can be entered to run commands that are 
    configurable in the config file:
    - console: start a console login
    - exit: exit SLiM (this may not have desirable results)
    - halt: shut down the system
    - reboot: reboot the system

    Pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified command (see the
    configuration file). The default is to take a screenshot, if the
    'import' program is available.
    
CONFIGURATION
    /etc/slim.conf is the main configuration file. Alternative files
    can be specified on the command line.
    Options are explained in the file itself
    
THEMES
    The appearance (and some parts of the behaviour) of SLiM depends
    on the "theme" specified by the configuration file. See the file
    THEMES for details.
