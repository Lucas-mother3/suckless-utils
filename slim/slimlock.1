.SH CONFIGURATION
Slimlock reads the same configuration files you use for SLiM. It looks in 
\fICFGDIR/slim.conf\fP and \fICFGDIR/slimlock.conf\fP, where \fICFGDIR\fP 
is defined when built - usually \fI/etc\fP.
The options that are read from slim.conf are 
hidecursor, current_theme, background_color and background_style, 
screenshot_cmd, and welcome_msg. See the SLiM docs for more information.

slimlock.conf contains the following settings:

.TP
.B dpms_standby_timeout
number of seconds of inactivity before the screen blanks.
.BI "Default: " 60
.TP
.B dpms_off_timeout
number of seconds of inactivity before the screen is turned off.
.BI "Default: " 600
.TP
.B wrong_passwd_timeout
delay in seconds after an incorrect password is entered.
.BI "Default: " 2
.TP
.B passwd_feedback_msg
message to display after a failed authentication attempt.
.BI "Default: " "Authentication failed"
.TP
.B passwd_feedback_capslock
message to display after a failed authentication attempt if the CapsLock is on.
.BI "Default: " "Authentication failed (CapsLock is on)"
.TP
.B show_username
1 to show username on themes with single input field; 0 to disable.
.BI "Default: " 1
.TP
.B show_welcome_msg
1 to show SLiM's welcome message; 0 to disable.
.BI "Default: " 0

1 to enable the bell on authentication failure; 0 to disable.

.SH BUGS
Where the theme defines a welcome message or password prompt, \fBslimlock\fP
displays them in the wrong place.
.PP
Using the same theme as \fBslim\fP assumes the theme is appropriate. Most of
the themes out there (including our defaults) put the word "Login" on the
panel, which isn't quite right for a screen lock.
.PP
To alleviate both of these, you can specify a different theme in 
\fICFGDIR/slimlock.conf\fP, which will override the setting in 
\fICFGDIR/slim.conf\fP, but you still need to find (or create) a suitable
lock theme.
