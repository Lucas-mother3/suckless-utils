Important things
----------------
- Make it work better with multi-screen setups

Improvements suggested long ago
-------------------------------
- Don't start X server if theme's not found
- i18n
- FreeBSD fixes
- restart X server on ctrl-alt-backspace

Other thoughts for improvement

- make slimlock handle themes the same as slim
- option to run X server as non-root
