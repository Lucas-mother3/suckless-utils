1.4.0 - 2023.01.21
	* - BREAKING CONFIG CHANGE - the position of the passwd_feedback in slim
	  is now relative to the screen, not the panel. This is now consistent 
	  with slimlock and with the session and other messages.
	* The selected session is now preserved over failed logins
	* When testing themes with the -p option, the size of the window can now
	  be specified, and the theme is previewed correctly for that size.
	* On exit from theme test, the "test message" now reports user and session
	* Failed login feedback is now disabled by default or if position negative
	* Applied some Devuan patches
	  - Set the XDG_SESSION_CLASS. This fixes Gentoo bug #727544 - failure to
	    register sessions with elogind in some instances. The (incorrect) bug
	    note in the man page has therefore been removed again.
	  - Use $DISPLAY instead of hardcoding :0.0 in sessionstart/stop commands
	  - No longer always builds slimlock if using PAM - it must be explicitly
	    enabled
	  - Fixed formatting in slimlock man page
	  - A couple of typos fixed in strings
	* Updated the README and encoded in UTF-8
	* Corrected the handling of the -n / -nodaemon option so that it doesn't 
	  swallow the next option if given as -n
	* Bug fixes in slimlock
	  - The active entry is for password, so show the password prompt, not the
	    username one
	  - Don't react to F1, as it isn't appropriate and used to blank the 
	    screen
	  - Keep it all on one screen even when the WM hasn't set a "primary" for
	    RandR purposes
	* Fix ticket #4 - the config parser now works properly. Previously it got
	  confused by option names that were substrings of other option names
	* Themes with "background_style color" no longer need a redundant image
	  file to make them work.
	  - This needed a bit of a re-write of the image handling, which also
	    improves efficiency
	* New default theme - the old one is retained as "original"
	* Some general documentation improvements (man pages, comments in example
	  files)

1.3.9 - 2022.11.18
    * Changed the handling of the "auth failed" message in DM mode so that it 
      remains on display until a key is pressed.
    * Added a command line option to specify the configuration file
    * Allow the logfile to be specified as "stderr" to write to stderr
      Also now writes all log messages to stderr if they are printed before 
      the log file is open, including when using the -p option.
    * Added a configuration option to retain the user name if authentication
      fails (which is probably more helpful if you just mistype your password)
    * Applied a modified version of the "wait for the X server" patch from guix
    * No longer unnecessarily re-opens an already open X display interface. 
      Similarly removed a redundant "get root window" call
    * Deleted some unused member variables and methods. Various other internal
      clean-up
    * Reverted the install location definition for the configuration file, as 
      the CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR wasn't right
    * Added a "bug" note to the man page, for the reliance on sessreg, which 
      causes occasional misbehaviour for some people.

1.3.8 - 2022.03.01
	* Fixed some bugs listed on bugs.gentoo.org:
	    832303 - failed to build with clang, Invalid suffix on string literal
	    580458 - open fd on /var/log/slim.log passed to session
	* Fixed handling of log stream so that all the code uses the same instance
	* Handle return values from calls, to clean up warn-unused-result warnings
	* Fixed "sessions" config option (the earlier patch was incomplete)
	* Several QA improvements
	* Updated cmake config - use standard install paths, don't force options

1.3.7 - 2022.01.30
	* Imported several bug fixes from the Gentoo package:
		libslim-cmake-fixes
		disable-ck-for-systemd
		reinstate sessions config option as an alternative to sessiondir
		systemd session compatibility
		remove zlib dependency
		envcpy-bad-pointer-arithmetic patch
		add-missing-libgen_h
		wrong comparison for XCreateGC error return (GCC11 needs it fixed!)
	* Fixed a bug in handling expired user accounts with PAM
	* Show a message on login failure (using the same method as slimlock)
